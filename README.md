# Documentations

**Reminder**, this is the 2022 course. i will not update to future courses. 
A flawless cat photo gallery from Freecodecamp **Responsive Web Design** Course. This Repo was created to showcase the website.
I will not be explaining any html elements or any html attribute as i believe users may use this repo to finish the course quickly.
I wish that you read all the resources first, so u will understand everything better and understand every part of it. This Repo 
was created since Yu14 Ywen (the Owner of this Repo) was taking the course on Freecodecamp. I wish to remind you that. Everything in the index.html file was the output of the course. 


The first part of the page allows you to see 3 images with a caption and some text.
The second part of the page allows you to submit a form to a website. The form is a proof of concept and sort of example. 

I will not be merging any PR related to index.html
other PR that will improve the readme will be merged.
